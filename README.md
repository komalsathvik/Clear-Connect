# 🚀 Clear-Connect – Your Next-Gen Web Conferencing Application! 🎥💻

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on **Clear Connect**, a full-stack web conferencing platform built using **WebRTC** and the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** — and I'm excited to finally share it!

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack Highlights

- 💻 **Frontend**: React with support for Light/Dark themes  
- 🌐 **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and WebRTC for real-time video communication  
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 for seamless login/signup and JWT for secure token-based authentication  

---

## 🎯 Core Features

✅ Create or join secure meetings  
✅ Real-time video & audio communication  
✅ One-click screen sharing  
✅ In-meeting chat & participant list  
✅ Toggle video/audio controls  
✅ Edit profile & view past meeting history  
✅ Fully responsive UI with dark/light mode support  

> 💡 Tip: Try connecting through different networks since **WebRTC** establishes peer-to-peer connections across varied environments.
